# Mixed-Player
Here I have created a basic Media Player and named it as "Mixed Player" an anroid application using #Flutter.
1) It can run local audio and video tracks .
2) There is also an option from which we can Play, Pause and Restart audio and video any time.
I used "audioplayer" packages and "chewie" packages for developing audio and video player resp.
